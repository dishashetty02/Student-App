# StudEasy App

The primary objective of the StudEasy Android app is to help students manage their academic and extracurricular activities efficiently. Instead of logging into Moodle or parent-login all the time students can use StudEasy to access information quickly. The app aims to provide a seamless and convenient experience for students. The app also aims to improve communication between students, faculty, and administration by providing important contact details and Faculty cabins of all the CSE lectures. StudEasy lets students check their attendance status, view their timetable, and get informed about upcoming classes and events. Ultimately, the objective of the StudEasy app is to contribute to the academic success of students by making their lives more comfortable and organized
